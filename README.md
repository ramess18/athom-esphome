### Changelog

<img src="img/ps01.jpg" width="250" align="right">

- now stores mmWave configuration values as it is supposed to
- add PIR delay in substitutions to configure no occupancy delay on PIR motion and Occupancy sensors
- Occupancy sensor logic is the same as Athom's
- smaller steps for configuration options allowing finer grained configurations
- sliders with too many options switched to number boxes
- remove on trigger delay of 50ms for even more responsive triggers (no idea why they're set in the first place)
- set button to internal since its a reset button and hard to reach
- remove factory reset button from HA device card, if you really want to reset use the web UI or the button
- disabled by default these diagnostic sensors: MAC address, SSID)
